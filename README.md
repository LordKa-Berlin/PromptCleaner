## üßæ Description

**PromptCleaner** is a lightweight GUI tool for cleaning up overloaded prompts used in AI image generation ‚Äì especially when those prompts include excessive **weightings** like `(term:1.2)` or nested parentheses.

The tool helps reset a prompt to a clean and neutral state by:

- Removing all parentheses `(` `)`
- Removing numbers, dots and colons associated with weightings (e.g., `:1.2`, `1.0)`)
- Simplifying complex or hard-to-read prompt structures
